			<h3>
				Product Details:
			</h3>
			<p>
				Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $350, packs larger displays and EKG sensor.
				The new smartwatch is set to bring a series of new features to your wrist and a 30 percent larger screen.
                If your heart's beating faster, the new Apple Watch Series 4 will be able to tell. The latest Apple Watch packs several new                 features,with the most obvious change on its surface: a redesigned face to put much more screen on your wrist. 
             </p>
          <h5>Design</h5>
			<p >
Apple kept the same design for three generations in a row (aside from some minor cosmetic tweaks, such as a new material and colour options, and a red spot on the cellular model). We were therefore expecting a major redesign for the Series 4 - and we got precisely that.
			</p>
            <h5>Large Screen</h5>
           		 <p>
            The most obvious change is the inclusion of screens which are more than 30% larger. They're now 40mm and 44mm (up from 38mm and 42mm).	            <br>Apple has achieved this by reducing the size of the bezels around the edge. The screen also has curved corners, fitting more             closely to the shape of the face.	
			  </p>
             	 <div class="container">
              			<img src="images/apple_watch_series_4_watch_faces.webp" width="500">
                </div>
                 <h5>Digital Crown</h5>
           		 <p>
           The Crown has been redesigned too, and now features haptic 'click' feedback as the dial is turned. Apple says this will allow for more accurate scrolling.
			  </p>
               <h5>Speaker & Microphone</h5>
           		 <p>
           Finally, the speaker has been bumped up - the company says it's 50% louder now - and the microphone aperture has swapped sides to move it away from the speaker. Hopefully this will all result in much better call quality.	
			  </p>
               <h5>Health Feature</h5>
           		 <p>
          Apple described the watch as "an intelligent guardian for your health", and backed that up with a raft of health-related updates.<br>
<p>
<h5>Fall detection</h5>
The Series 4 is clever enough to work out when you're falling - it works this out from the movement of your arms, which are different when falling to when slipping or doing other similar actions.<br>
If you fall and then remain still for a certain time, it will assume that something bad has happened and contact the emergency services and send your location to your emergency contacts using the SOS feature.
